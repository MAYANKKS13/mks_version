# mks_version

This is a music app I have made using Angular. <br>
<h3>I have made this app as a fan of Taylor Swift consisting of songs from her various albums on my own way that's why it's name is mks_version. </h3>

<h4>Now, this is possible that anyone can clone this repo and can make this app further in their own way and can present to the world but I want to make this clear that this app is mine only that I have made as a fan of her. <br>
Everything in this app, content, designing, ideas, pics averything I have added on my own. This I want to make clear. </h4>

<h3>
  I have made this on my local machine more than two months ago and pushed on my local repo and right now I have pushed it in the github at 19:11 IST on 3rd December, 2023 and rn writing all these things in the README file and commiting changes of this file at time 19:28 IST, 3/12/2023 to fully upload it in the github.
